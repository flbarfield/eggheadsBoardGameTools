<h2>Summary</h2>
Created for analog game enthusiasts, Egghead's Board Game Tools is created to make running games easier and more enjoyable! The application is in the early development phase, but it will include extensive data for Dungeons and Dragons to be used as quick references, as well as a combat initiative tracker that will allow you to add and delete monsters as well as timed environmental effects on the battlefield on the fly. The user will be able to track their list of board games thanks to data gathered from board game list APIs, which will also have a randomizer function for those times their board game groups simply can't pick what game they want to play next. For miniatures, I would like to implement a way to take pictures of terrain and specific miniatures, and the app will return other buyable pieces that match said terrain and miniatures in order to complete a whole set or simply see where the original came from. <br/><br/>

This is all being built with React, Next.js, MongoDB, JavaScript, and Tailwind.

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
This has been a pet project that's allowed me to fully understand the excellent user experience that React and Next.js allow the developer to create, from no-page reload DOM changes to faster load times due to declaring portions of the page to be statically generated on the server side or dynamically rendered on the client's side! In learning it, I've also gained an understanding of how I would separate components in a sensible way for not only myself but also for a team of other developers, so that we could each work on a portion of our application with enough abstraction to not disrupt one another's code. I've also been writing all of the styles purely in Tailwind to get a good handle on it's "classNames" to speed up development and better contain component elements within it's specific file.
